        <p>I am a Front-end Developer-cum-tech enthusiast. hands-on experience in UI
           Web and Mobile app development using Javascript Based Frameworks.I have
            developed over time good debugging and error-detecting skills.<br/><br/>

          I am also very eager to pick coding styles and standards worked on by fellow
          developers and re-invent them to suit my use. I have expertise on different Javascript
          frameworks such as Angular 2+ , React JS ,  Vue JS , React Native etc.<br/><br/>

          I have excellent CSS3, HTML5, Javascript and Typescript skills as well.My favorite
          pastime is solving word problems and taking up coding challenges on various platforms
           which also doubles up as a skill sharpening experience for me.I am always up-to date
            with the latest tech news and all the recent technological developments happening in
             the tech world around me.<br/><br/>

          My core strength is that I am always on the look out for new learning whenever i come
           across other websites/tech platforms which i find very appealing and always make it a
            point to learn the 'Why' and 'How' part of it.</p>
